            	   	<p>The global e-Commerce market size is valued at USD 9.09 trillion with an annual growth rate of 14.7%. 
			The 2020 pandemic dramatically changed people's lifestyles. E-Commerce will further accelerate its growth and penetration into people's daily lives. 
			E-Commerce websites and apps are among the top visits of everyone's daily routine. Customers want E-Commerce websites and apps as their personal assistant that 
			finds the exact products they are searching for, provides recommendations when they are not sure which products to buy, and answers questions about product details. 
			Extracting structural knowledge about e-Commerce products from their text descriptions, images, reviews, customer interaction logs is the key for building 
			delightful shopping experience for search, recommendation, advertising, and product QA. Many challenges in building a product knowledge base can benefit from the 
			learnings of building a semantic web. On the other hand, the unique data in e-commerce can spike new research directions in the web conference community. 
			The KMEcommerce workshop aims to bring together researchers from both academia and industry labs to exchange notes and get a pulse for the state of art of 
			improving e-commerce customer experience with product knowledge mining and management.

		<h2>Call For Papers</h2>
		<div class="content">
            		<p>The Knowledge Management in E-Commerce Workshop welcomes submissions from both researchers and industry practitioners in
			    knowledge discovery and applications for e-Commerce, including data
			    cleaning and (unsupervised/weakly supervised) learning from noisy data, representation learning and embeddings, information
			    extraction from text and graphs, user behavior modeling, and applications such as search, recommendation, advertising and QA. 
			    <b>Full paper submissions</b> (maximum 8 pages) are solicited in the form of research papers which propose new techniques and
			    advances with industrial potential as well as papers from industry that describe practical applications and innovations in e-Commerce applications. 
			    <b>Short papers</b> (maximum 4 pages) describing case studies or work-in-progress are also solicited. Exceptionally well-argued position papers are also welcome.
			</p>
			<p>In addition to short and long papers above, we welcome <b>extended abstracts (1-2 pages)</b> covering topical areas of research that are appropriate for the workshop. 
			   Authors of selected abstracts will be invited for oral presentations.
			</p>
			<p>Top papers from the workshop will be selected for the <b>June 2021 IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin Journal</b>. See previous Journal since 1977 here: https://dblp.org/db/journals/debu/index.html </p>
