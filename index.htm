            	   	<p>The global e-Commerce market size is valued at USD 9.09 trillion with an annual growth rate of 14.7%. 
			The 2020 pandemic dramatically changed people's lifestyles. E-Commerce will further accelerate its growth and penetration into people's daily lives. 
			E-Commerce websites and apps are among the top visits of everyone's daily routine. Customers want E-Commerce websites and apps as their personal assistant that 
			finds the exact products they are searching for, provides recommendations when they are not sure which products to buy, and answers questions about product details. 
			Extracting structural knowledge about e-Commerce products from their text descriptions, images, reviews, customer interaction logs is the key for building 
			delightful shopping experience for search, recommendation, advertising, and product QA. Many challenges in building a product knowledge base can benefit from the 
			learnings of building a semantic web. On the other hand, the unique data in e-commerce can spike new research directions in the web conference community. 
			The KMEcommerce workshop aims to bring together researchers from both academia and industry labs to exchange notes and get a pulse for the state of art of 
			improving e-commerce customer experience with product knowledge mining and management.

					<h4>Tracy Holloway King</h4>
					<img src='./img/tracy.jpg' width="120" height="100" style='float: left;padding-right: 10px'/>
					<h5>Bio:</h5>
 					<p>  Tracy Holloway King is currently a principal scientist in Adobe's Sensei and Search organization, focusing on natural 
						language processing. She is trained in linguistics at Stanford and worked as a researcher and research manager in PARC's Natural Language Theory and 
						Technology group. She then moved into applied research in Microsoft's Bing search team. She was a product manager and 
						an engineering manager in the Search Science applied research team at eBay, focusing on eCommerce search across the eBay sites. 
						At A9 and Amazon, she focused on natural language processing for product search query understanding and then on utilization 
						for sponsored products. Currently she is a principal scientist at Adobe working on search and natural language processing.

					<h5>Talk Title: Integrating 3rd-Party Knowledge Graphs: Lessons from Adobe Stock</h5>
					<h5>Abstract:</h5>
					<p>
						Building knowledge graph (KG)-based features in an eCommerce site involves many steps from deciding whether to build the KG yourself 
						or use an existing one to integrating the KG into the eCommerce architecture and running AB tests for KG-based features. In this talk, 
						I present lessons learned from integrating a 3rd-party KG into Adobe Stock. Adobe Stock sells stock assets such as photos, 
						illustrations, and videos. Customers can search for assets in over 20 languages. Adobe Stock wanted a KG with mappings to these 
						languages to improve search relevance. Relevance issues included missing mappings from concepts to specific languages and cross-talk 
						from text-based asset tags. For example, on the French site, the query "pain" (bread) returned assets showing people with injuries 
						due to the English textual tag for pain. We also wanted the KG to help with recommendations and intelligent back-off for null results 
						queries. Lesson learned: be clear on your top priority use case for the KG and evaluate against that. We did an initial evaluation to 
						determine whether the 3rd-party KG would be appropriate and what it would entail to integrate it into our systems. Lesson learned: 
						evaluation of KGs requires significant time around applied science and engineering. After licensing the KG, we built a platform to 
						host it, an extracted sub-graph for use in Adobe Stock, tools for different views, and an integration pipeline for the search index 
						and query. Lessons learned: build tooling first so that you can quickly debug issues; design for the long run, but prioritize ruthlessly 
						for what to build first. After building the first small search indices, many of the issues we knew to expect from the evaluation were 
						showing up: the named entity mappings were overapplying; there were missing and orphaned mappings with some languages missing mappings 
						for a concept; the confidence scores on the mappings were crucial for removing edge cases. Lesson learned: Knowing that an issue will 
						arise and planning in advance how to address it is important but there is still a lot of work to take those plans to production. After 
						adjusting for the known issues, we then conducted an extensive search relevance evaluation to look for remaining issues and to determine 
						whether we needed to retrain the ranker with the new KG. Lesson learned: repeated evaluation after changes is imperative to catch 
						remaining issues. Overall, we believe we made the right decision to integrate a specialized 3rd-party KG into Adobe Stock: the KG 
						integration into Adobe Stock will bring greatly improved search relevance to our customers, especially for languages other than English, 
						French, and German, while providing a more modular architecture around concept mappings. But for future KG explorations we will pay 
						careful attention to the lessons learned for a faster path to production.

					<h5>Bio:</h5>
 					<p>  Omar Alonso is a principal data scientist lead at Microsoft in Silicon Valley, where he works on the intersection of social media, 
						temporal information, knowledge graphs, and human computation. He is the co-organizer of DESIRES, a new information retrieval conference 
						with a focus on system implementation and experimental design (http://desires.dei.unipd.it/). He was also co-chair of the crowdsourcing 
						and human computation track for WWW 2019. He holds a PhD from the University of California at Davis and an undergraduate degree 
						from UNICEN, Argentina.
					</p>
					<h5>Talk Title: Domain specific knowledge graphs: challenges and opportunities </h5>
					<h5>Abstract:</h5>
					<p>
						There is a lot of interest in knowledge graphs as a rich structure that can be used in many applications like search, recommendation, 
						and question-answering. While there are examples of knowledge graphs in industry and academia, there is little information on the 
						practical aspects of construction and integration with other components.  We describe some of the challenges and opportunities, and 
						outline the current efforts at Instacart to build a knowledge graph about food and related topics to help users with their information needs.
