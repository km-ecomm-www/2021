            	   	<p>The global e-Commerce market size is valued at USD 9.09 trillion with an annual growth rate of 14.7%. 
			The 2020 pandemic dramatically changed people's lifestyles. E-Commerce will further accelerate its growth and penetration into people's daily lives. 
			E-Commerce websites and apps are among the top visits of everyone's daily routine. Customers want E-Commerce websites and apps as their personal assistant that 
			finds the exact products they are searching for, provides recommendations when they are not sure which products to buy, and answers questions about product details. 
			Extracting structural knowledge about e-Commerce products from their text descriptions, images, reviews, customer interaction logs is the key for building 
			delightful shopping experience for search, recommendation, advertising, and product QA. Many challenges in building a product knowledge base can benefit from the 
			learnings of building a semantic web. On the other hand, the unique data in e-commerce can spike new research directions in the web conference community. 
			The KMEcommerce workshop aims to bring together researchers from both academia and industry labs to exchange notes and get a pulse for the state of art of 
			improving e-commerce customer experience with product knowledge mining and management.
